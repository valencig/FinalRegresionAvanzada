  <em>Prevalence of alcohol use disorders
  It’s estimated that globally around 1.4 percent of the population have an alcohol use disorder. At the country level, as shown in the chart, this ranges from around 0.5 to 5 percent of the population. In Russia, for example, the prevalence is 4.7 percent meaning that almost 1-in-20 have an alcohol dependence at any given time.

  When we look at the variance in prevalence across age groups we see that globally the prevalence is highest in those aged between 25 and 34 years old (for which around 2.5 percent of the population have an alcohol use disorder). At the extreme of country-level figures, prevalence amongst Russians aged 30-34 years old is just under 10 percent. This means 1-in-10 Russians in this age group has an alcohol dependency.

  Globally, 107 million people are estimated to have an alcohol use disorder. This breakdown can be viewed by gender for any country here; 70 percent globally (75 million) were male relative to 32 million females.

  The scatter plot compares the prevalence of alcohol use disorders in males versus that of females. In 2017 — with the exception of Ukraine — the prevalence of alcohol dependence in men was higher than in women across all countries.</em>

Variable description	Population by country, available from 1800 to 2019 based on Gapminder data, HYDE, and UN Population Division (2019) estimates.
Variable time span	10000 BCE – 2019
Data published by	Gapminder, HYDE (2016) and United Nations Population Division (2019)
Data publisher's source	HYDE aggregated estimates published in earlier publications. The series are named after these publications.
Link	http://www.gapminder.org/ and https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd003/
Population data by country is taken from Version 5 of Gapminder. This provides data by country from 1800 through to 2100. The Gapminder dataset is available online at http://www.gapminder.org/.

The regional, and world, long-run population series was constructed by Our World in Data based on two key sources: the HYDE database (2016) and UN's World Population Prospects (2019).

- HYDE (2016) data is used from the year -10,000 to 1940
- UN World Population Population Prospects (2019) from 1950 to 2019;
- Projections to 2100 from the UN World Population Population Prospects (2019)

HYDE regions have been aggregated to match with UN regional groupings:
- 'Europe' and 'CIS' in HYDE data have been combined and labelled here simply as 'Europe'
- 'Asia' and 'Middle East' in HYDE data have been combined and labelled here simply as 'Asia'

HYDE Database, available at: https://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/basicdrivingfactors/population/index-2.html

From 1950 to 2019, country, region, and world estimates come from the UN Population Revision (2019), and projections to 2100 from the UN Population Revision (2019) medium variant scenario.

## life-expectancy
  How has cross-country life expectancy changed in the long-run?
  The visualization summarises available life expectancy data over the last few centuries. The estimates from the UK – the country for which we have the longest time-series – show that life expectancy before 1800 was very low, but since then it has increased drastically. We can see that in less than 200 years the UK doubled life expectancy at birth. And the data shows that similarly remarkable improvements also took place in other European countries during the same period.

  The chart also shows large historical changes in life expectancy estimates for other countries. Notice, for example, that a century ago life expectancy in India and South Korea was as low as 23 years – and a century later, life expectancy in India almost tripled, and in South Korea almost quadrupled.

  You can switch to the map view in this visualization by clicking on the corresponding tab, in order to compare life expectancy across countries. The map shows that, despite long-run cross-country convergence, there are still huge differences between countries: people in some sub-Saharan African countries have a life expectancy of less than 50 years, compared to 80 years in countries such as Japan.

  The increase in life expectancy happened to a significant extent because of changing mortality patterns at a young age, but this was not the only reason: life expectancy increased for people at all ages.

LIFE EXPECTANCY

Data was compiled by Our World in Data based on estimates by James C. Riley, Clio Infra, and the United Nations Population Division.

For regional- and global-level data pre-1950, we use data from a study by Riley, which draws from over 700 sources to estimate life expectancy at birth from 1800 to 2001.

Riley estimated life expectancy before 1800, which he calls "the pre-health transition period". "Health transitions began in different countries in different periods, as early as the 1770s in Denmark and as late as the 1970s in some countries of sub-Saharan Africa". As such, for the sake of consistency, we have assigned the period before the health transition to the year 1770. "The life expectancy values employed are averages of estimates for the period before the beginning of the transitions for countries within that region. ... This period has presumably the weakest basis, the largest margin of error, and the simplest method of deriving an estimate."

For country-level data pre-1950, we use Clio Infra's dataset, compiled by Zijdeman and Ribeira da Silva (2015).

For country-, regional- and global-level data post-1950, we use data published by the United Nations Population Division, since they are updated every year. This is possible because Riley writes that "for 1950-2001, I have drawn life expectancy estimates chiefly from various sources provided by the United Nations, the World Bank’s World Development Indicators, and the Human Mortality Database".

For the Americas from 1950-2015, we took the population-weighted average of Northern America and Latin America and the Caribbean, using UN Population Division estimates of population size.

## life-expectancy-vs-health-expenditure
  The graph below shows the relationship between what a country spends on health per person and life expectancy in that country between 1970 and 2015 for a number of rich countries.

  The US stands out as an outlier: it spends far more on health than any other country, yet the life expectancy of the American population is not longer, but actually shorter than in other countries that spend far less.

  If we look at the time trend for each country, we first notice that all countries have followed an upward trajectory—the population lives increasingly long lives as health expenditure increases. But again, the US stands out by following a much flatter trajectory: gains in life expectancy from additional health spending in the U.S. are much smaller than in the other high-income countries, particularly since the mid-1980s.

LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH, TOTAL (YEARS)
Variable description	Life expectancy at birth indicates the number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life.

Limitations and exceptions: Annual data series from United Nations Population Division's World Population Prospects are interpolated data from 5-year period data. Therefore they may not reflect real events as much as observed data.
Statistical concept and methodology: Life expectancy at birth used here is the average number of years a newborn is expected to live if mortality patterns at the time of its birth remain constant in the future. It reflects the overall mortality level of a population, and summarizes the mortality pattern that prevails across all age groups in a given year. It is calculated in a period life table which provides a snapshot of a population's mortality pattern at a given time. It therefore does not reflect the mortality pattern that a person actually experiences during his/her life, which can be calculated in a cohort life table.

High mortality in young age groups significantly lowers the life expectancy at birth. But if a person survives his/her childhood of high mortality, he/she may live much longer. For example, in a population with a life expectancy at birth of 50, there may be few people dying at age 50. The life expectancy at birth may be low due to the high childhood mortality so that once a person survives his/her childhood, he/she may live much longer than 50 years.

Per capita health expenditure here is measured in 2010 international dollars.

The definition of health spending given by the OECD is the following: "Health spending measures the final consumption of health care goods and services (i.e. current health expenditure) including personal health care (curative care, rehabilitative care, long-term care, ancillary services and medical goods) and collective services (prevention and public health services as well as health administration), but excluding spending on investments. Health care is financed through a mix of financing arrangements including government spending and compulsory health insurance (“public”) as well as voluntary health insurance and private funds such as households’ out-of-pocket payments, NGOs and private corporations (“private”). This indicator is presented as a total and by type of financing (“public”, “private”, “out-of-pocket”) and is measured as a share of GDP, as a share of total health spending and in USD per capita (using economy-wide PPPs)."

# Link between mental health and suicide
The link between mental health and substance use disorders and suicide is well-documented.12 It is however true that not all suicides – or suicide attempts – are attributed to underlying mental health or substance use disorders; as shown in the chart, there is not a direct relationship between mental health prevalence and suicide rates.13

We cover suicide statistics more broadly in our full entry on Suicide, however here we attempt to distil the key findings on the links between mental health and substance use and suicide. Although mental health and substance use disorders is within the top-five causes of disease burden globally (as measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years; DALYs), accounting for approximately 7 percent of the burden, several authors have highlighted that such figures — since they do not include suicide DALYs — underestimate the true cost of mental health disorders.14

Providing a more accurate estimate of total mental health burden therefore requires some understanding of the connection between these disorders and suicide.

Meta-analyses of psychological autopsy studies of suicide across high-income countries suggest that up to 90 percent of suicides occur as a result of an underlying mental health or substance use disorder.15

While available data and studies are more scarce across lower-to-middle income countries, evidence across countries including China, Taiwan and India suggest that this proportion is significantly lower elsewhere.16

These studies suggest a large number of suicides resultant from the ‘dysphoric affect’ and ‘impulsivity’ (which are not defined as a mental and substance use disorder). In such cases, understanding the nature of self-harm methods between countries is important; in these countries a high percentage of self-harming behaviours are carried out through more lethal methods such as poisoning (often through pesticides) and self-immolation. This means that in a high number of cases self-harming behaviours can prove fatal, even if there was not a clear intent to die.

A study by Ferrari et al. (2015) attempted to determine the share disease burden from suicide which could be attributed to mental health or substance use disorders.17

Based on review across a number of meta-analysis studies the authors estimated that 68 percent of suicides across China, Taiwan and India were attributed to mental health and substance use disorders; across other countries this share was approximately 85 percent. In their estimates of total attributable disease burden, the authors concluded that mental health and substance use disorders were responsible for 62 percent of total DALYs from suicide.
